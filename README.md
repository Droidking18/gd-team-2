our game will consist of 1 main goal which is to reach the finish line, your character will parkour on top of multiple buildings and through obstacles to reach said finish line in the fastest time possible.

## 1: Game overview: 

**Game concept (high level definition of the game):** So the essence of the game is that you are a single character in a setting of modern architecture and you are simply trying to jump from building to building to reach a finish line. While on your way you will encounter obstacles similar in nature to the game Subway Surfers where you must decide whether to jump over, dodge to the side, or slide under the obstacles to keep the momentum going.

## 2: Gameplay mechanics: 

**Core Gameplay Loop:** the main loop will be jumping from one building roof to the next, while moving from side to side and scaling the building if the jump is not perfect etc. with possible extra obstacles for more engagement. 

**Controls:** main movement will be done through WASD and space bar with the hope of adding more complex features such as climbing and sliding later on.
